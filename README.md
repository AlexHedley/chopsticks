What is included.

- 1 board.
- 3 sushi.
- 2 chopsticks.
- 2 scoring pegs.
- 1 rules sheet.

The game will come in a plain brown, 2 piece, telescopic box.

## Rules

## Set up

 Place the board on a level and stable surface. Give each player a chopstick and a  scoring peg.  Agree which sushi piece to start with.

## Play

Place the sushi in the sushi bowl at the centre of the board.

Address the sushi.

Using only your chopstick, manoeuvre the sushi into your opponents’ top or bottom goal. See Scoring.

Record your score on your scoring track with your scoring peg.

Continue playing for points until there is a winner.

## Addressing the sushi

You address the sushi by touching it with the end of your chopstick  (do not move the sushi). Keep touching the sushi with your chopstick until your opponent addresses the  sushi too. When both players have been touching the sushi for a moment (lets say 1 second) play can begin.

## Sushi  off the  board

Sushi will often jump off the board.  Restart play on the chopsticks markings nearest to  where the sushi went out.  Address the sushi and continue play.

## Scoring

When you get the sushi into your opponents’ bottom goal score 1 point. Record the  point with your scoring peg. If you get the sushi to remain in your opponents’ top goal you score 3  points.  At this point, feel free to do a celebratory dance as this is a very  rare event.  Don’t forget to record this remarkable achievement with your scoring peg.

## Change  the sushi

After any points are scored against you, you may choose which piece of sushi to restart with.

## Holding  the chopstick  

Hold your chopstick at the very end so that your hand is as far away from the action as  possible.  The best way to achieve this is to hold the chopstick between your middle  finger, index finger and thumb.

## Winning

The first player to score 8 points wins.

## Point after  goal  variant

After scoring in the bottom goal place the sushi in the centre bowl and have 1 flick  attempt to get the sushi into the top goal. If successful, score 1 additional point.

## Doubles

Two teams of two players. 1 player from each team starts the game. After the first point is scored that team swaps their player. After the next point is scored the other team swaps their player. Teams continue to alternately swap their player after every point is scored until the game ends.

## Chopsticks Party. (5 or more players)

Assign each player a number. Players 1 and 2 start. When a player scores they remain in play and the other player must swap out with next highest numbered player. When there is no higher numbered player they swap out with the lowest numbered player.
